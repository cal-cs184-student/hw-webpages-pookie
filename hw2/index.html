		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p> This project/homework heavily relied on a strong foundational knowledge of meshes, and thus alot of my time was spent reviewing my understanding 
			of half edges, verticies, faces, and connecting components. I found that debugging with regular techniques was less helpful than just having a detailed 
			overview of how I expected my code to work. I've also been trying out Github Copilot, which has helped me code and in this writeup, specifically with website formatting
			and debugging.

		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		
		<p>I linearly interpolate between each of these control points and then find the point at each of these interlopations at some parameter t, leaving us with n-1 points. The formula is as follows: p’i = (1 - t)pi + t*pi+1 . I keep performing these subdivisions with evaluateStep until I get to the final point, at which I have traced out our bezier curve! Here is an example with 6 control points: </p>

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		<p>We can extend the Casteljau algorithm to bezier surfaces by trying to think of it as two dimensional with parameters u and v. To get the point at  u,v, we first linearly interpolate across the curves that define the surface across v. Then, we should have a point for each curve that defines this surface. Finally, we can linearly interpolate along these new points with u, and after finishing de Casteljau’s algorithm, we should have a point that is linearly interpolated along both the u axis and v axis. The basic idea is linearly interpolate with parameter v along n curves (n rows in the algorithm) using evaluate1D (which steps through the curve with evaluateStep until we have a final point) for each curve, resulting in n single control points (each corresponding to a row in the matrix, remember we can visualize a row as an individual bezier curve). Then, I interpolate along these n final control points with parameter u (think about this as interpolating amongst columns) using evaluate1D again.. I think of this as the de  Casteljau algorithm extended to 2D. Here is the result, “./meshedit ../bez/teapot.bez”, of my implementation:</p>

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		
		<p>I implemented area weighted normals by using a modified neighboring vertex traversal. Given our vertex v, I traverse all the half edges that point back to v. I use the vertex that defines this half edge (the vertex where the half edge is pointing from), v, and the third vertex found by h->next()->twin()->vertex() to define a face incident to our vertex v. I call these vertices the left and right vertices in respect to v. To compute the normal, for each of these incident faces, I sum up the cross product of the vector from left->v and v->right, then divide by 2 (remember area of a triangle is (½ * width * height). Think of the magnitude of the cross product as the rectangular space enclosed between these two vectors. I keep checking for incident faces until we reach back to our original half edge, which is when we know our traversal is complete. I use the unit method to normalize the vector sum of face areas. Now because we are computing the face area with vectors starting from the left vertex and v instead of both vectors starting from v, we end up with an oppositely oriented normal that points towards the inside of the model. I solve this by simply reversing the normal of the sum of face cross products by multiplying by negative 1. </p>

		<p>Area weighted vertex normals are used for phong shading, and we can see the results here: </p>

		<p>Without shading:</p>

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		
		<p>Implementing the edge flip operation was tricky because it demands a very strong understanding of all the proper allocations of pointers for vertices, edges, and faces. I implemented this edge flip by drawing out a diagram from class: </p>


		<img src="edgeflipd.png" width="400px"/>

		<p>I collected all the edges, halfedges, and faces of the original edge with half edge traversal </p>

		<p>In order to not delete or add any variables, I simply acted as if the edge given to us and the half edges corresponding to it were now the new edge and half edges. I saved a lot of headache by simply reassigning every pointer of these two half edges to ones of the new half edges. I similarly changed the pointer of the edge given to us and the half edges of the face. The best way I can describe this is that I treated the half edges, edge, and original faces of the original edge/half edges as the new elements in our modified mesh. </p>

		<img src="teaonlyflip.png" width="400px"/>

		<p>Debugging journey: </p>

		<p>I found that the half edge data was very helpful for trying to debug/gain intuition for this task. I would take a screen shot of the half edge before I flipped the edge, and then a screenshot after and compare the memory addresses of the elements according to my implementation to see if my code had accurately implemented my drawings/ideas. </p>

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		<p>I implemented edge splits similarly. I drew a diagram of all the updated pointers, and what the new mesh would look like. In order to prevent any deletions, I treated the two old faces as two new ones by reassigning all their pointers, and treated the edge given to me as the edge with the same half edges pointing away from the new vertex, m. 

			Here is my implementation: 
		</p>

		<img src="edgesplitd.png" width="400px"/>

		<p>Similar to part 4, I collected all the edges, halfedges, and faces of the original edge with half edge traversal </p>
		<p>In this example, you can see how if we were given edge b-c, I would treat this edge as edge m-c and assign the half edges accordingly. In order to prevent most bugs, I reassigned all the pointers to every face, vertex, edge and half edge using the setNeighbors function. Here is an example so you can see the difference: </p>

		<p>	Just edge splits: </p>

		<img src="tsplit.png" width="400px"/>

		<p>	Edge flips and splits: </p>

		<img src="tsplitandflip.png" width="400px"/>

		<p>	Another example of edge split and then flip: </p>

		<img src="flipnsplit1.png" width="400px"/>

		<p>	Zoomed in: </p>
		<img src="flipnsplit1zoom.png" width="400px"/>

		<p>As you can see the combination of edge splits and edge flips creates a unique pattern. In my debugging journey, I ran into issues with face deletion. Here are some examples of what I ran into: </p>

		<img src="debug1.png" width="400px"/>

		<img src="debug2.png" width="400px"/>

		<p>I used the check_for function to check if I had the correct number of half edges pointing to each face like so: </p>

		<img src="dlog.png" width="400px"/>

		<p>Eventually I realized that I had 4 pointers to the old edges and only 2 to the new ones. This was a mistake in how I interpreted reassigning the faces (and also partially my understanding of faces). After I corrected this, I was able to split the edges successfully! </p>


		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		<p>Loop subdivision was the hardest part for me to implement. I began with traversing all the vertices in the mesh, setting each vertex’s isNew parameter to false. Then using half edge traversal, I calculated the degree of the vertex and sum of all its neighboring vertices. </p>

		<p>The new position of the vertex in the subdivided mesh is following this formula: </p>

		<p>If degree of vertex is 3, u = 3/16 
			Else, u = 3/(8*degree)
		</p>

		<p>begin_vertex->newPosition = (1 - n*u) * begin_vertex->position + u * sum;</p>

		<p>I then assigned the newPosition parameter to store where the vertex would be in the subdivided mesh. After I did this, I also traverested the edges and calculated the new position for each edge, similarly storing it in newPosition.</p>

		<p>The new edge position is calculated as follows: </p>

		<p>begin_edge->newPosition = \( (3.F/8.F)*(A->position+B->position) + (1.F/8.F)*(C->position+D->position) \);</p>

		<p>Where (A, B) are the vertices of the edge, which will eventually be split, and (C, D) are the vertices that the new outgoing edges from edge split will be connected to. </p>

		<p> After this, came the challenge of splitting the edges. In order to make sure I wasn’t iterating over new edges generated from splitting the old ones, I created a vector list to store all the initial edges, and only traversed these old ones and split them. As I split the edge, I updated the new vertex generated to represent a new vertex and its newPosition as the position on the edge it was split from. In the splitEdge function, I also updated all the edges to represent whether they were new edges generated from the split or old ones. Now, we are ready to flip edges. In order to do this while traversing the edges in the new mesh, I had to ensure that each edge we were flipping was an edge between an old vertex and a new vertex. I also had to ensure that the edge was a new edge created from splitting edges. This is where the isNew parameter I had assigned in early traversals for edges and vertices came in handy, as I was easily able to check for these conditions with a couple of if statements. After these conditions were verified, I flipped the edge. After flipping edges, I simply had to update all the vertex positions to their new positions in the subdivided mesh.</p>

		<p>An issue I had with subdivision was that sometimes I would be flipping edges that were old as well. I realized that when I was splittingEdges, I had to explicitly set the isNew parameter of the old edges to False. This is because if I didn’t do that, the isNew parameter is set to a garbage value since it is initialized, and comparing it to True led to undefined behavior. This is definitely going to be helpful knowledge about C++ down the line! </p>

		<p>Loop subdivision is helpful to smooth out corners and edges, leading to a less jagged, more visually pleasing result. Here is an example from ../dae/icosahedron/input.dae</p>

		<img src="hed1.png" width="400px"/>
		<img src="hed2.png" width="400px"/>
		<img src="hed3.png" width="400px"/>

		<p>Our object is a lot more rounded now! </p>

		<p>I also tested my implementation on dae/cube: </p>

		<img src="cubebad1.png" width="400px"/>
		<img src="cubebad2.png" width="400px"/>

		<p>As you can see, especially after the wire frame is toggled off, the edges and sharp corners do not smooth out completely. The cube is also asymmetrically spiky, with only a couple sharp points sticking out. This should not be the behavior we want, since a cube is an inherently symmetrical geometric object. Here is the cube after a couple of initial subdivisions, to see how this behavior is inherent to the mesh of the cube and how the asymmetry becomes less pronounced but still apparent after subdivisions: </p>

		<img src="originalcube.png" width="400px"/>
		<img src="cube1.png" width="400px"/>
		<img src="cube2.png" width="400px"/>
		<img src="cube3.png" width="400px"/>

		<p>This is likely because in the initial mesh, each square face of the cube only has one diagonal edge on each face. Therefore, when we split edges we are only splitting across the one diagonal, then when we flip these new edges the width of the object gets smaller while the unflipped edge (the original diagonal) remains longer. This problem can be solved by initially splitting the edges at each face, so we have symmetry in terms of subdivision across each face horizontally and vertically. </p>

		<p>Here is the result of splitting the edges initially:</p>

		<img src="cubesplit.png" width="400px"/>
		<img src="nicecube1.png" width="400px"/>
		<img src="nicecube2.png" width="400px"/>
		<img src="nicecube3.png" width="400px"/>
		<img src="nicecube4.png" width="400px"/>

		<p>As you can see, the cube is now symmetrically subdivided across each face, leading to a more visually pleasing result. Our cube is a lot smoother and symmetrical now!</p>
